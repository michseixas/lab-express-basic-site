    <p>Back to the Future is an American science fiction comedy franchise created by Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale.</p>
        
    <p>
    The franchise follows the adventures of a high school student, Marty McFly, and an eccentric scientist, Dr. Emmett "Doc" Brown, 
    as they use a DeLorean time machine to time travel to different periods in the history of the fictional town of Hill Valley, California.
    </p>

    <p>The first Back to the Future film was the highest-grossing film of 1985 and became an international phenomenon, leading to the second and third films,
        which were back-to-back film productions, released in 1989 and 1990, respectively.
    </p>     
        
    <p>Though the sequels did not perform quite as well at the box office as the first film, 
        the trilogy remains immensely popular and has yielded such spin-offs as an animated television series 
        and a motion-simulation ride at the Universal Studios Theme Parks in Universal City, California; Orlando, Florida;
        and Osaka, Japan (all now closed), as well as a video game and a stage musical. The film's visual effects were done by Industrial Light and Magic. 
    </p> 

    <p>The first film won an Academy Award for Sound Editing.</p>
